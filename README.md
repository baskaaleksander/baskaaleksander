### Hey there!

I’m **Aleksander Baska**, a backend engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade systems.

I enjoy designing and implementing distributed architectures, event-driven pipelines, and AI-powered platforms treated as backend workloads rather than experiments.

If a system looks complex, asynchronous, or hard to scale - chances are I want to build it.
