### Hey there!

I’m **Aleksander Baska**, a Java backend engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade systems.

I enjoy designing and implementing distributed architectures, event-driven pipelines, and AI-powered platforms treated as backend workloads rather than experiments.

If a system looks complex, asynchronous, or hard to scale - chances are I want to build it.

### What I do

- Backend-oriented engineer with a strong focus on **Java and Spring Boot**
- Design and implementation of **microservices and event-driven systems**
- End-to-end ownership: architecture, backend, messaging, storage, observability, deployment
- Currently building a **multi-tenant AI knowledge platform** using Kafka, vector search, and knowledge graphs

### Technical focus

- **Languages:** Java (primary), Python, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, REST APIs  
- **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Clean Architecture, DDD

- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Qdrant, Neo4j  
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Linux, Nginx  
- **Observability:** Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, structured logging  
- **Testing:** JUnit, Testcontainers, Mockito

### Currently improving

- Distributed system design and failure handling  
- Backpressure, retries, and idempotency in event-driven systems  
- Scaling ingestion and search pipelines  
- Production observability and performance tuning
